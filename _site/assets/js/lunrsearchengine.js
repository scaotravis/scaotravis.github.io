Install hoo in R What’s new Upcoming featuresWhat is hoo?: hoo is an R package used for multimodal data analysis. It is used alongside rENA. hoo creates an appropriate ENA accumulated model that can be used by rENA to produce ENA set. You can call rENA plotting functions on such ENA set to generate points and network plots to analyze connections between player interactions. For more on how to interpret ENA model and plotted network, consult Epistemic Analytics Lab at University of Wisconsin-Madison. Install hoo in R: To install this repository in R as a package, run the following commands: install. packages( devtools )devtools::install_github( scaotravis/hoo@v3. 4. 5 )library(hoo)What’s new: Version 3. 4. 5 (May 29, 2019):  Included parameter referenceMode to customize what mode of data the reference line should be when calculating connections within a moving stanza window (defaults to include all modes of data). Version 3. 4. 4 (May 15, 2019):  Fixed a wording issue in hoo. ena. accumulate. data() help document. Version 3. 4. 3 (April 12, 2019):  When replacing the adjacency vectors created by rENA::ena. accumulate. data() with hoo generated adjacency vectors, hoo now uses a more robust grepl() assisted subset method to avoid erroneous replacement. Version 3. 4. 2 (March 24, 2019):  Cleaned up redundant codes.  Included hoo. horizon. DT() method that utilizes data. table structure and lapply() function in attempt to increase performance. Version 3. 3 (March 23, 2019) (pulled on March 24 due to performance decrease) Verison 3. 2 (January 29, 2019):  Now, all methods from hoo comes with prefix hoo. , which helps you distinguish methods called by hoo class. Version 3. 1 (November 14, 2018):  Included function hoo. ena. accumulate. data() to directly generate ENA accumulated model for ENA set creation.  Reordered some arguments for a more logical ordering. Version 3. 0 (November 11, 2018):  Included dataset mock for testing and example demonstration.  windowSize for whole conversation data now takes value 1 (uses the same standard as rENA). Upcoming features:  Directly generate appropriate ENA accumulated model for ENA set creation. (Available since v3. 1) Use type data. table on dataset to increase performance. (Prototype available in v3. 4. 2) Consider C version of hoo to increase loop performance. "
