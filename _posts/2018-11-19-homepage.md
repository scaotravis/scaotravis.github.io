## Welcome!

My legal name is **Shengyang Cao**; I go by Travis most of the time.

I am an undergraduate senior pursuing B.A. degree in economics and mathematics at University of Wisconsin-Madison. My research interests lie in the fields of environmental economics, public economics, econometrics, and applied microeconomics.

Below are some quick access links. You can also expand the floating menu at the upper left corner to navigate around my website.
